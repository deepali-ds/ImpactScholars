Exploring the impacts of humid heatwave dynamics and population density on heat exposure risk in India 

Overview

This project analyzes heatwave trends and their impact on heat-related deaths (HRDs) across Indian states from 2001 to 2022. Using ERA5 reanalysis data, we identify heatwave events based on Wet Bulb Temperature (WBT), requiring WBT to exceed the 90th percentile for at least three consecutive days. The study examines correlations between heatwave intensity, population density, and HRDs, revealing insights into regional vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies.

Key Features

    Heatwave Identification: Uses ERA5 temperature & dewpoint data to compute WBT and flag heatwave events.
    Time-Series Analysis: Tracks heatwave trends and HRDs at both national and state levels.
    Correlation Studies: Explores relationships between heatwave days, HRDs, and population density.
    Case Study Years: Focuses on 2005, 2015, and 2019, examining extreme events.
    Interactive Visualizations: Generates stacked bar charts, scatter plots, and dual-axis time-series graphs.
    Policy Implications: Highlights state-specific adaptation strategies and urban heat mitigation measures.
